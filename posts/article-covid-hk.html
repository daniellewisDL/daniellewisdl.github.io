                            When will this pandemic be over, and when can we get back to normal life, or at least a 'new normal'? I tend to agree with
                            <a href="https://www.peterhinssen.com/">Peter Hinnsen</a>, who coined the phrase 'the new normal', that in fact, the tech
                            and social media revolution of the 2010s, the impending seismic shifts in society required to address the climate crisis,
                            and now, topped off with the global pandemic, we are entering a new era of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHXD4jsuamM">the never normal</a>".

                          <h4>The pandemic of the early 2020s</h4>
                          <p>
                            In what turned out to be the early days of the pandemic, I was texting a colleague who was based in Mexico in July 2020, and
                            I - somewhat jokingly - said to him that my only hope was that in the future, people would refer to it as the pandemic of 2020,
                            not the pandemic of the early 2020s. Unfortunately, as I write this now in February 2022, it seems that my grim fear has already
                            come to pass, and that predictions of when SARS-COV-2's impact on humanity will dwindle to the background chatter is easily
                            stretching into 2023 and 2024. Perhaps beyond.

                            This episode reminded me of the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/time-traveler-conversation">time traveller conversation</a>
                            joke format, which can be refactored in many different ways but the basic idea is that a time traveller inadvertently reveals
                            information about the future:
                            <br>

                            <cite>
                              A time traveller enters FDR's Oval Office in 1935, claiming to have some knowledge that could shape foreign policy. FDR responds,
                              stating that having been Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the War to end all Wars, having been Governor of New York during
                              the 1929 Wall Street Crash, and now being President, there was nothing that the time traveller could say that would phase him.
                              The time traveller states that he didn't know that FDR was in the Navy during the First World War. FDR goes quiet momentarily,
                              eventually saying softly, "You mean there's a second one?"

                            The echo here, need I spell it out, is that now my great hope is that we do indeed refer to this as the pandemic of the early 2020s,
                            and not, say, The First Great Pandemic, or worse, the Lesser Pandemic...

                          <h4>Covid's Metamorphoses</h4>
                          <p>
                            In early 2020, I set up a family group chat to keep in touch better, as lockdowns and other policy measures were introduced.
                            I gave the chat the punny title of "Covid's Metamorphoses", in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses">
                            poem</a> by Ovid. This was way before any variants of interest had even been mooted by the WHO, but again, looking back, with all the
                            strife that the Greek-letter-monikered mutations of SARS-COV-2 have caused, it seems my harmless pun had a bleakly prescient sting.

                          <p>
                            Living in Hong Kong during this pandemic, as foreigners with two young children, has been, and remains, a difficult experience.
                            The sword of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles">Damocles</a> that still hangs over our heads has been that at any
                            point we could be separated from our children, who might have to go to a spartan Government-run quarantine facility for three
                            weeks, <a href="https://youtu.be/99fY1dEzcnQ?t=144">alone.</a>

                          <p>
                            During 2020, I wanted quick access to clear data on the number and source of cases in HK, and latterly the number of vaccinations,
                            and the number of people in quarantine. While there were some dashboards and update pages available, most of these were and still
                            are bloated with ads, difficult to find quick and easy access to the stats. The HK Government has been very good in publishing the
                            raw data, and offering API or programmatic access to the data. So I decided to build a small web app with Python, Streamlit, and
                            deployed to the cloud via Heroku. I recently refreshed the app given the exponential increase HK is facing.
